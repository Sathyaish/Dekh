I just saw the Jasmine API. In case you don't know, Jasmine is a unit-testing framework for testing your JavaScript applications. It must have been written in JavaScript (or one of its variants -- Babel, CoffeeScript, TypeScript) I imagine but I haven't looked. That's the idea.

I saw the API and it struck me to be so simple, I thought I might venture writing my own implementation. So, here's my attempt to write a Jasmine clone without looking inside the source of Jasmine. It's a bare bones clone. I'll keep adding more API as I discover their own API more.

I've also written a basic manual unit test suite for testing JavaScript apps. It's not that big a deal.

I'm calling this thing Dekh in a spur of the moment.
